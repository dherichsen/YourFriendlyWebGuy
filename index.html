                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><strong>S</strong>ince</b> graduating from Mercersburg Academy, a small boarding school tucked away in the rolling hills of south-central Pennsylvania, life has taken me on quite the journey.  Day one of freshman year I could have sworn that accounting was my calling.  I understood numbers well and manipulation better.  Business was for me.  It wasn't until the end of sophomore year when I barreled into the startling realization that I had in fact manipulated myself into believing that a career knotted in guaranteed financial freedom was all I yearned for.  I had eschewed my dreams, aspirations and creative prowess in replace for a career encompassed by monotony and money.  Trapped in an unfamiliar stagnancy, I found my motivation asphyxiated by the trepidation of an uncertain future.  Then I decided on a whim to take an introductory course on computer science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second I successfully compiled and ran my first program I was hooked.  Having just gotten my toes wet, I became fascinated with all the possibilities that computers could offer.  Already more than halfway to a business degree, I substituted marketing for accounting and continued onward.  Since then, I made it my mission to vigorously chase anything and everything that peaked my attention.  My hobbies expanded into occupations.  I produced music because I wanted to DJ what I made.  I travelled back and forth across the country because I got bored in one place.  I sold coats at Columbia because Minnesota got cold and bartended because I wanted to learn.  I started writing a book because well...why not?  Some would say I spread myself thin, but I would argue that trying everything is the only way to truly find what thing you want to do every day.

Ideally I prefer to design and develop custom websites.  My main focus is to make each website unique and robust.  I try to use CSS(3) for presentation and Javascript for functionality.  Additionally, I prefer to use SASS (a CSS preprocessor) to design and organize my CSS.  More will be added shortly.  Thanks for visiting!

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><strong>W</strong>hen</b> I first stumbled upon web design and development, I was pretty clueless.  One of the key components in my journey understanding all things web related were the numerous, and readily available tutorials that some incredible individuals took the time to write in order to aide the education of others.  I kept track of many of the instrumental tutorials/articles/lessons that helped me and have organized them into the space below so that anyone who stumbles across my site can gain some of the awesome knowledge that was freely given to me!
