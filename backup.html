                        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><strong>M</strong>y</b> name is Dave Erichsen and I am a business major/programmer who specializes in front end web development and design.  I have been a freelancer but now that I have settled down in Palm Beach County I am looking to explore permanent employment as well.  I designed and developed this page to demonstrate my web related work and abilities.  After taking linear algebra at night this spring I will have a B.S. in Business Adminstration with a concentration in Marketing and Double-Major in Computer Science.  I would love to hear from you so please don't by shy!</p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since graduating from Mercersburg Academy, a small boarding school tucked away in the rolling hills of south-central Pennsylvania, life has taken me on quite the journey.  Day one of freshman year I could have sworn that accounting was my calling.  It wasn't until the end of sophomore year when I barreled into the startling realization that I had in fact manipulated myself into believing that a career knotted in guaranteed financial freedom was all I yearned for.  I had eschewed my dreams, aspirations and creative prowess in replace for a career encompassed by monotony and money.  Trapped in an unfamiliar stagnancy, I found my motivation asphyxiated by the trepidation of an uncertain future.  Then I decided on a whim to take an introductory course on computer science.
                            <br/><br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second I successfully compiled and ran my first program I was hooked.  Having just gotten my toes wet, I became fascinated with all the possibilities that computers could offer.  Already more than halfway to a business degree, I substituted marketing for accounting and continued onward.  Since then, I made it my mission to vigorously chase anything and everything that peaked my attention.  My hobbies expanded into occupations.  I produced music because I wanted to DJ what I made.  I travelled back and forth across the country because I got bored in one place.  I sold coats at Columbia because Minnesota got cold and bartended because I wanted to learn.  I started writing a book because well...why not?  Some would say I spread myself thin, but I would argue that trying everything is the only way to truly find what thing you want to do every day.

From Thursday through Saturday night in college one could often find me behind the decks somewhere.  More recently I have focused my attention on producing, and will hopefully have some tracks uploaded soon!  Please follow me David Erichsen on Soundcloud and check out some of my posts and likes!</p></div>
                        <div class = "interests-desc"><p>There's no substitute for an <b>adventure</b>!  Whether its piling into a car with friends or hitting the pavement a lone wolf, nothing beats a good journey.  From Richmond to San Diego, Boston to Miami or just a weekend cruise to a campground, there's always something to be gained from a new experience.  Driving is one of my favorite avenues to practice mindful meditation in day-to-day life!</p></div>

I personally love and take part in all forms: reflective to gain a better understanding of my past experiences, creative to unleash the universe of my inner child's imagination and poetic when I need to relinquish feelings that just don't fit into the syntactical constructs of proper grammar.  One day I would love to publish somethings for free-- after all, anything I write is just an accumulation of what I've learned from the world.</p></div>
                        <div class = "interests-desc"><p><b>Yoga</b> is a newfound passion of mine that has revolutionized my life.  This practice has filled a void I didn't even realize was vacant.  A while ago I crashed into the realization that I live the majority of my life in the past or expecting things in the future.  Yoga has given me the ability to live life in the present and be in the now.</p></div>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><strong>W</strong>elcome</b> to my workspace.  Here you will find a few of my projects along with a respective description.  Ideally I prefer to design and develop custom websites.  My main focus is to make each website unique and robust.  I try to use CSS(3) for presentation and Javascript for functionality.  Additionally, I prefer to use SASS (a CSS preprocessor) to design and organize my CSS.  More will be added shortly.  Thanks for visiting!

One of the key components in my journey understanding all things web related were the numerous, and readily available tutorials that some incredible individuals took the time to write in order to aide the education of others.  I kept track of many of the instrumental tutorials/articles/lessons that helped me and have organized them into the space below so that anyone who stumbles across my site can gain some of the awesome knowledge that was freely given to me!
